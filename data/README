1. g++-2; 	1.14s;	0.87GB/s	fastest, unknown idea
2. main		1.46s;	0.68GB/s	my multithreaded idea with memmove and 2B reversing at once	
3. gcc-2	1.58s;			multi-threaded idea with memmove
4. gcc-5	1.91s;			single-threaded basic idea with memmove

5. plain copy   0.6s; 1.66GB/s	        raw (cache) I/O
6. read + write 0.9s
7. main-2       1.4s;                   main but with only 2 threads
8. main-3       1.74s;                  single-threaded main

cp to existing - only ~150MB/s - it use SSD instead page cache.
